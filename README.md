# Riddle Game
This website is a riddle game, built using **Flask**, which is a python microframework. The target audience for this website is any user who wants to play a riddle game for entertainment. The game asks players to enter a player name and answer a number of text based riddles correctly to complete the game.

## UX
The following section describes the UX process for this project.

#### UX Process
1. **Layout** - Reviewed the Code Institute learnings to date and Bootstrap themes to extract design ideas.
2. **User Stories** - Walked through user stories.
    1. **Header Call-to-action** - As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website and intuitively understand how to use it.
    2. **Navbar - Contact** - As a user, I want to be able to contact the developers to offer feedback and suggestions.
    3. **Navbar - Riddle Game** - As a user, I want to be able to select the landing page, and be presented with a blank player name textarea.
    4. **Navbar - Game** - As a user, I want to be able to restart the game, and be presented with a blank player name textarea.
    5. **Enter Player Name** - As a user, I want to be able to enter a unique player name into a textarea, and start the game.
    6. **Start Game** - As a user, once I select start game, I want to be greeted with my player name, to be presented with the first riddle and my player name to be displayed in a list.
    6. **Answer Riddles** - As a user, I want to be able to enter an answer into a textarea, submit an answer and if I provide the correct answer, be redirected to the next riddle.
    7. **Enter Incorrect Answer** - As a user, I want to be able to enter an answer into a textarea, submit an answer and if I provide an incorrect answer, the textarea is cleared, redirecting me to a blank textarea to guess again.
    8. **List Incorrect Answer** - As a user, I want to be able to view incorrect answers, displayed in a list.
    9. **Answer all Riddles Correctly ** - As a user, when I have answered all riddles correctly, I want to be redirected to an end of game message.
3. **Wireframe** - Sketched the wireframe on paper, to include the features for each user story, meeting the users needs by presenting the data on a dashboard charting web application.

### Features to Implement
1. **Leaderboard** - Add a feature to include a scoring system that ranks all players.

Improve how incorrect answers are displayed with the player name.

## Technologies Used
The following section describes all technologies and tools used to construct this project.

- [Cloud 9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
    - The project used **Cloud 9**, online integrated development environment, to construct the code end to end.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - This project uses **Bootswatch**, a library of Bootstrap themes. The [Clean Blog Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/), was used for this project.
        - **Static folder**: Contains Bootstrap files (no other files stored within this folder).
        - **`base.html` and `contact.html`** - Most of this html code was copied from the bootstrap `index.html` and `contact.html` files as a boiler plate template, then amended to suit this project.
        - **All Other Code**: Compiled by the project developer.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - This project uses **Flask**, a Python micro web framework. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Flask offers beneficial functionality such as template logic, which allows the `base.html` file to be inherited on other html files via `{% extends 'base.html' %}`, `{% block content %}`, and ` {% endblock %}` jinja code.
- [Jinga](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
    - This project uses **Jinja**, a template engine for Python.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - This project uses **Python**, an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming and used to write the logic of this game.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    - This project uses **HTML**, the standard mark-up language used to build website layout, which was written in this project within the `.html` files.
- [JSON](https://json.org/)
    - This project uses **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a text-based data interchange format designed for transmitting structured data. It is most commonly used for transferring data between web applications and web servers. A JSON file was used as a database in this project to retreive the riddle information.
- [.txt files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file)
    - This project uses **.txt files**, a file to store text and was used in this project to write to and read from, for exmaple when a player enters a player name and selects start game. 
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
    - This project uses **Javascript**, an object-oriented programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. Javascript within this project was part of the Bootstrap template.
- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
    - This project uses **Chrome Dev Tools**, a set of web developer tools, to continuously test and inspect that the web pages are rendering as expected within the browser.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - This project uses **GitHub**, a web hosting service, for version control and final project deployment.
- [All Other Technologies](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)
    - All other technologies within this project were included with the Bootstrap template.

## Testing
The following is an overview of testing to ensure all functionality works as intended in this project.

1. **Navbar - Contact**:
