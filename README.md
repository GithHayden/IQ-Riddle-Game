# Riddle Game
This website is a riddle game, built using **Flask**, a Python micro-framework. The target audience for this website is any player who wants to play a riddle game for entertainment. The game asks players to enter a player name and answer a number of text based riddles correctly, to complete the game.

## UX
The following section describes the UX process for this project.

## Technologies Used
The following section describes all technologies and tools used to construct this project.

- [Cloud 9 IDE](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/)
    - The project used **Cloud 9**, online integrated development environment, to construct the code end to end.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - This project uses **Bootstrap**, a library of website themes. The [Clean Blog Template](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/), was used for this project.
        - **Static folder**: Contains Bootstrap files ONLY (no other files stored within this folder).
        - **`base.html` and `contact.html`** - Boiler plate html was copied from the bootstrap `index.html` and `contact.html` files, then amended to suit this project.
        - **All Other Code**: Compiled by the project developer.
- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - This project uses **Flask**, a Python micro-framework. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Flask offers beneficial functionality such as template logic, which allows the `base.html` file to be inherited on other html files via `{% extends 'base.html' %}`, `{% block content %}`, and ` {% endblock %}` jinja code.
- [Jinga](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
    - This project uses **Jinja**, a template engine for Python, which is included with the curley brackets.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - This project uses **Python**, an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming and used to write the logic of this game, which is included within `.py` files.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    - This project uses **HTML**, the standard mark-up language used to build website layout, which was written in this project within the `.html` files.
- [JSON](https://json.org/)
    - This project uses **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), which is a text-based data interchange format designed for transmitting structured data. It is most commonly used for transferring data between web applications and web servers. A JSON file was used as a database in this project to retreive the riddle information.
- [.txt files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file)
    - This project uses **.txt files**, to store text and was used in this project to write data to and read data from.
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
    - This project uses **Javascript**, an object-oriented programming language used to create interactive effects within web browsers. Javascript within this project was included with the Bootstrap template.
- [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
    - This project uses **Chrome Dev Tools**, a set of web developer tools, to continuously test and inspect that the web pages are rendering as intended within the browser.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
    - This project uses **GitHub**, a web hosting service, for version control and final project backup.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home)
    - This project uses **Heroku**, a web hosting service that supports Python applications, for final project deployment.
- [All Other Technologies](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/)
